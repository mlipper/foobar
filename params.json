The first 6 bytes of the standard BBL consists of the 1-byte borough code followed by the 5-byte tax block field, which contains the tax block value right-justified and zero-filled. The last 4 bytes of the 10-byte standard BBL is the standard tax lot field, which contains the tax lot value right-justified and zero-filled.\r\n\r\nField     | Length | Position | Comments\r\n--------- | ------:| --------:| --------\r\nBoro Code | 1      | 1-1      |\r\nTax Block | 5      | 2-6      | RJZF\r\nTax Lot   | 4      | 7-10     | RJZF\r\n\r\n*Description*: The BBL (“borough-block-and-lot”) identifies a parcel of real property in New York City, called a tax lot. The BBL is composed of the concatenation of the Borough Code, Tax Block and Tax Lot. If the property is a condominium (indicated by the Condominium Flag), the WA2 BBL field contains the billing BBL of the condominium.\r\n\r\n\r\n### bblBoroughCode <a id=\"wa1-bblBoroughCode\"></a>\r\n\r\n*See*: [bbl](#wa1-bbl)\r\n\r\n\r\n### bblTaxblock <a id=\"wa1-bblTaxblock\"></a>\r\n\r\n*See*: [bbl](#wa1-bbl)\r\n\r\n\r\n### bblTaxlot <a id=\"wa1-bblTaxlot\"></a>\r\n\r\n*See*: [bbl](#wa1-bbl)\r\n\r\n\r\n### buildingIdentificationNumber <a id=\"wa1-buildingIdentificationNumber\"></a>\r\n\r\n* *Functions*: address, bbl, bin, place\r\n* *Length and Format*: 7 bytes. Numeric\r\n\r\n*Description*: Building Identification Number (BIN). A permanent BIN is a seven-digit numerical identifier unique to each building in the City of New York. The first digit is the Borough Code. There are also two types of temporary BINs; those maintained by the Dept. of Buildings (DOB) and those maintained by the Dept. of City Planning (DCP). The temporary BINs assigned by DOB contain the number ‘8’ as the second digit, and the temporary BINs assigned by DCP contain a ‘9’ in the same position. DCP is currently in the process of phasing out all of its temporary BINs.\r\n\r\n### firstBoroughName <a id=\"wa1-firstBoroughName\"></a>\r\n\r\n* *Functions*: address, bbl, bin, blockface, intersection, place\r\n* *Length and Format*: 9 bytes\r\n\r\n*Description*: Normalized borough name of the first input boroughCode.

Address numbers are commonly called ‘house’ numbers (although this term is a misnomer, since many addresses refer to buildings other than houses). New York City house numbers consist of a ‘basic house number’, possibly followed by a ‘house number suffix’. (Note: the basic house number and house number suffix are not to be confused with the digits to the left and right of the hyphen in a hyphenated house number. For example, in the Queens address ‘240-55 1/3 DEPEW AVENUE’, ‘240-55’ is the basic house number, and is hyphenated; ‘1/3’ is the house number suffix.) Only a very small percentage of New York City addresses have house number suffixes.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n## Address\r\n<!-- function-id=\"1B\" -->\r\n\r\nAddress requests are handled by calling Geosupport function 1B. Function 1B returns blockface-level information and political geography, followed by property level information for a given input. Work Area 2 consists of the output of a Function 1E call with Mode Switch = 'X' followed by the output of a Function 1A call with Mode Switch = 'X'. The input requires borough or zip code, address number if needed, and street name or street code. Function 1B retrieves the tax lot and building information from the PAD file based on the input. The block face and political data are then retrieved from the GRID and the Election files for the address set by the building level information.\r\n\r\n[attributeBytes](#wa1-attributeBytes)\r\n[bblBoroughCode](#wa1-bbl)\r\n[bblTaxBlock](#wa1-bbl)\r\n[bblTaxLot](#wa1-bbl)\r\n[bbl](#wa1-bbl)\r\n[buildingIdentificationNumber](#wa1-buildingIdentificationNumber)\r\n[firstBoroughName](#wa1-firstBoroughName)\r\n[firstStreetCode](#wa1-firstStreetCode)\r\n[firstStreetNameNormalized](#wa1-firstStreetNameNormalized)\r\n[geosupportReturnCode](#wa1-geosupportReturnCode)\r\n[houseNumberSortFormat](#wa1-)\r\n[houseNumber](#wa1-)\r\n[lowHouseNumberSortFormat](#wa1-)\r\n[lowHouseNumber](#wa1-)\r\n[message](#wa1-message)\r\n[nin](#wa1-)\r\n[numberOfStreetCodesAndNamesInList](#wa1-)\r\n[reasonCode](#wa1-reasonCode)\r\n[secondStreetCode](#wa1-secondStreetCode)\r\n[secondStreetNameNormalized](#wa1-secondStreetNameNormalized)\r\n[streetAttributeIndicator](#wa1-)\r\n[streetCode`N`](#wa1-)\r\n[streetName`N`](#wa1-)\r\n[thirdStreetCode](#wa1-thirdStreetCode)\r\n[thirdStreetNameNormalized](#wa1-thirdStreetNameNormalized)\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n## Geosupport Return Codes and Reject Handling\r\n\r\nGeosupport has an elaborate apparatus to support application problem-handling. There are three output fields that are used to inform calling applications of the outcome of each call to Geosupport.  These fields are the Geosupport Return Code (GRC), the Reason Code and the Message.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
